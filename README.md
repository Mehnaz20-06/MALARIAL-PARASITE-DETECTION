# Malarial-parasite-detection-using-YOLO
We are using YOLO v5 model to detect malaria paraiste which we have classifed into three types i.e vivax falciparum and normal 
it can identify the malarial parasite in a microscopic sample

**Tech Stack**: 
Python, YOLOv5, Roboflow, PyCharm, OpenCV


[^1]●	Built an object detection model in YOLOv5, trained using Roboflow pipelines and managed via PyCharm, targeting parasitic cells in blood smear images.
[^2]●	Processed, cleaned, and annotated 1,500+ microscopic images from Chittagong Medical College Hospital to create a reliable training dataset.
[^3]●	Achieved 67% diagnostic accuracy, validating the model’s potential use in assisting medical experts in
resource-limited clinical environments.
[^4]●	Performed image preprocessing, data augmentation, and bounding box tuning to improve model robustness and generalization for unseen samples
